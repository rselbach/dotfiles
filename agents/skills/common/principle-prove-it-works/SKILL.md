# Prove It Works

Verify every task output by checking the real thing directly. Do not infer from proxies, self-reports, or "it compiles."

**Why:** Unverified work has unknown correctness. Indirect verification (file mtimes, output freshness, agent self-reports, cached screenshots) feels cheaper than direct observation. Acting on a wrong inference costs far more than checking the source.

**Pattern:** After completing any task, ask: "how do I prove this actually works?"

Check the real thing, not a proxy:
- Check process liveness directly, not indirectly through derived state
- Read the actual value, not a cached or derived representation
- When verification fails, suspect the observation method before suspecting the system

Choose checks for the changed behavior and preserve repository-required checks.
Build when compilation is affected, exercise changed runtime paths, and test
the communication path when an integration changes. Run performance checks
when performance is at risk. Reuse passing evidence while the code,
dependencies, and environment it covers remain unchanged. Report gaps rather
than treating inapplicable or unavailable checks as passes.

Delegation: trust artifacts, not self-reports.
When verifying delegated work, inspect the actual output artifact (git diff, file contents, runtime behavior), not the delegate's summary. Agents report what they intended, not always what happened.

## Script the check when you can

Prefer existing repeatable checks. Write a new script when it materially
improves repeatability or avoids repetitive verification, not merely because
the task is non-trivial. Keep useful output as evidence for the reviewer.

Keep the artifact visible for the human. Commit it only for large or complex work where the trail has to be auditable later, like a big port or migration (the **show-me-your-work** skill). Most work just needs it visible, not committed.
